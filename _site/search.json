The decreasing autocorrelation beyond a few lags indicates short-term memory in the data, supporting the application of seasonal time series models such as ARIMA.\nSeasonal Plot by Month:\nMonthly patterns also highlight consistently higher rainfall in November - December, aligning with the Northeast monsoon season.

After this period, the trend stabilizes, suggesting a phase of relatively consistent long-term rainfall levels. These trend shifts may be attributed to broader climatic changes, urbanization impacts, or variations in extreme weather events.\nSeasonal Component:\nThe seasonal pattern remains stable and consistent across the years, with recurring annual patterns - highlighting the influence of Singapore’s biannual monsoon seasons. This consistent seasonality reinforces the presence of regular intra-annual rainfall cycles typical of equatorial climates, making the STL approach well-suited for uncovering both short-term anomalies and long-term rainfall dynamics in the region.\nRemainder Component:\nThe remainder captures short-term, irregular fluctuations not explained by trend or seasonality. Sharp spikes and dips suggest the influence of extreme rainfall events or anomalies, which may correspond to localized storms or data irregularities.

In contrast, Cluster 2 contains time series that appear more consistent and closely aligned in their temporal patterns, suggesting strong cohesion within the cluster.

ARIMA model can effectively capture the autocorrelation characteristics in time - series data, that is, the correlation between the current value and the historical value, and use this correlation to predict future values.\nModel flexibility: ARIMA model has a variety of parameter combinations, which can be adjusted according to the characteristics of different rainfall data sets to better fit the data and improve the prediction accuracy.\nConsideration of stationarity: Before using the ARIMA model, the stationarity of the data is usually tested and processed. This is very important for rainfall data, because the non - stationarity of rainfall data is common. By making the data stationary, the model can better extract the inherent law of the data and improve the prediction effect."

    "text": "As a tropical island nation, Singapore experiences dynamic rainfall patterns influenced by monsoon seasons, climate change, and localized weather variations. Sudden heavy downpours can lead to urban flooding, disrupting transportation and daily life. With increasing unpredictability in weather patterns, developing data-driven predictive insights is crucial for effective climate adaptation and urban resilience.\nBy analyzing rainfall patterns both spatially (geographic variations) and temporally (seasonal and long-term trends), we can detect anomalies, shifts, and emerging precipitation trends. Integrating time-series forecasting models further enables short-term and long-term rainfall predictions, supporting early warning systems, infrastructure planning, and climate mitigation strategies. This study aims to bridge the gap by quantifying rainfall variability and forecasting future precipitation to enhance decision-making. The insights gained will not only provide the public with more accurate weather information for better planning but also equip authorities with scientific data to improve flood warnings and emergency response measures in vulnerable areas."

Extreme rainfall indicators, such as maximum 30/60/120-minute rainfall intensities, will be computed to detect extreme weather patterns. Additionally, seasonal variables, including monsoon season labels (Northeast/Southwest monsoon periods) and ENSO indices (El Niño/La Niña), will be integrated to assess the impact of climate variations on rainfall trends."

The inverse distance power parameter (idp) is set to 0, implementing uniform spatial weighting to avoid overemphasis of isolated high/low points.

These areas consistently experience slightly elevated rainfall due to topography and vegetation.\nThe northeastern and eastern parts of the island (including Changi, Punggol, and Pasir Ris) showed lower rainfall values (100-140 mm).

In contrast, the Ordinary Kriging map displays smoother gradients, offering continuous transitions in rainfall estimates that reflect a more natural spatial variation.\nHotspot areas:\nBoth methods identify rainfall hotspots in the western and central regions of Singapore. However, while the IDW map presents these areas with clearly defined boundaries, the Kriging map portrays similar hotspots with a more diffused and realistic spatial spread, aligning with expected spatial autocorrelation patterns.\nLow-rainfall zones:\nIn the eastern and northeastern zones, the IDW map shows distinctly delineated low-rainfall areas, whereas the Kriging map reflects a similar trend but with more gradual transitions, resulting in a smoother interpretation of rainfall decline across space.\nInterpolation quality:\nOverall, IDW performs well in areas with dense station coverage, but it may oversimplify spatial variability, especially where rainfall patterns are complex. Ordinary Kriging, on the other hand, provides statistically optimal estimates, particularly effective when spatial dependence is strong."
