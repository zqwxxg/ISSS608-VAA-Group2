    "text": "As a tropical island nation, Singapore experiences dynamic rainfall patterns influenced by monsoon seasons, climate change, and localized weather variations. Sudden heavy downpours can lead to urban flooding, disrupting transportation and daily life. With increasing unpredictability in weather patterns, developing data-driven predictive insights is crucial for effective climate adaptation and urban resilience.\nBy analyzing rainfall patterns both spatially (geographic variations) and temporally (seasonal and long-term trends), we can detect anomalies, shifts, and emerging precipitation trends. Integrating time-series forecasting models further enables short-term and long-term rainfall predictions, supporting early warning systems, infrastructure planning, and climate mitigation strategies. This study aims to bridge the gap by quantifying rainfall variability and forecasting future precipitation to enhance decision-making. The insights gained will not only provide the public with more accurate weather information for better planning but also equip authorities with scientific data to improve flood warnings and emergency response measures in vulnerable areas."

    "text": "Data Pre-processing\nTo ensure data consistency and accuracy, the collected datasets will undergo preprocessing before analysis. This process includes data cleaning, transformation, and integration of meteorological and geospatial data to prepare them for extreme rainfall prediction.\n\nData Collection & Integration: Historical rainfall data from 62 MSS stations will be downloaded monthly, merged, and standardized into a single structured dataset for spatial and temporal analysis.\nHandling Missing Values: Short-term missing values in rainfall, temperature, humidity, and wind speed will be handled using linear interpolation, while longer gaps will be smoothed using moving averages.\nTime-Series Processing (Resampling & Aggregation): Hourly rainfall data will be aggregated into daily, monthly, and seasonal trends to detect long-term variations and rolling averages will be applied for extreme event detection.\nGeospatial Data Processing: Longitude and latitude of rainfall stations will be retrieved using Google Maps & AI tools, enabling spatial interpolation (Kriging, IDW) for mapping rainfall intensity.\nFeature Engineering: To enhance the predictive accuracy of rainfall models, several features will be engineered. Extreme rainfall indicators, such as maximum 30/60/120-minute rainfall intensities, will be computed to detect extreme weather patterns. Additionally, seasonal variables, including monsoon season labels (Northeast/Southwest monsoon periods) and ENSO indices (El Niño/La Niña), will be integrated to assess the impact of climate variations on rainfall trends."
